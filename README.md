Gallery for jewelry shop.

I made this gallery for a friend to showcase her jewelry making. 
This website was a great learning experience after finishing a web developing course.
It includes HTML, CSS (Grid), Javascript, PHP and mySQL. 

I wrote scripts to enable product managemnt inside the database (uploading, deleting and editing products).
Everything done by hand so it might not be perfect but was a great learning experience.
